# BandCHIP Assembler

This CHIP-8 assembler is capable of assembling CHIP-8, SuperCHIP, XO-CHIP, and HyperCHIP-64 programs.  The assembly language
used is based on [Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM).  However, some
of the instructions follow the original CHIP-8 behavior (though should still work on most interpreters that follow the
quirky behavior).

## Requirements for Compiling

- [CMake](https://www.cmake.org/download) (at least 3.10)
- C++ Compiler with C++11 Support

## Documentation
